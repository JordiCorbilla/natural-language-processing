# NLP

NLP is the technology behind machine translation. It's alsu useful for Text-to-speech (translating voice commands into text), caption generation (visualizing an image and generating a brief description) and question-answering type of projects (questioning a computer and receiving an intelligent answer).

Language is something that is fairly new in terms of evolution and it only relates to humans. Trying to build a computer that could understand language as we do would mean building an intelligent computer and we are still quite far away from it.
